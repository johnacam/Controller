# Controller
This repository is for my infrared optical controller project I created for the course ECE243 - Computer Organization.
It is implemented on two DE1-SoC boards, with the FPGA configured as a NIOS-V soft processor. One board is connected, through the GPIO expansion ports, to a IR LED driving circuit. The other board is simmilarily connected to a IR photodiode.
All code for this project is written in C and RISC-V assembly.
